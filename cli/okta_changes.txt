This only appears to work for AWS federated applications.

in the okta console for an aws account:

1. Sign On -> "Allowed WEb SSO Client" -> <Okta application ID of the native app>

in the okta console for the native app:

1. Okta API Scopes -> okta.apps.read
1. Grant Type -> Authorization Code, Device Authorization, Token Exchange, Refresh Token
2. Refresh Token -> Use persistent token
